# Website

The conversion from SfS-specific CMDI to HTML is currently being served at (VPN access required):

```http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/converter/CMDI2HTML/ ```

# Status

The software has no official release yet. The software has experimental support for CMDI v1.2.

CMDI2HTML exploits context-specific information from SfS-based CMDI profiles to
minimize information loss.

A recent edition has been the inclusion of a link for CMDI Explorer. For this,
the file "CMDI2HTML_xslt1.0.xsl" has been added to the webapps directory. At the
time of writing, it is this file that is currently served by the TALAR repository.
